# Timber
A desktop video game inspired by Timberman.

You are a lumberjack whose goal is to achieve the highest score possible by cutting down as much of wood as possible from an endlessly tall tree.

There is a 6 second timer before the game ends. 

Each time you cut down a piece of the tree, you earn 1 point and add a little bit of time back to the timer.

However, the tree has a chance that it contains a branch on either side of it, you do not want to be under a branch when you cut down a piece of the tree, 
as that will end the game immediately!

The name of the game is to cut down the tree as fast as possible to get the best score without losing too quickly from the branches.

CONTROLS:
Esc - Exits the game
Enter - Starts the game
Left Arrow Key - Move to the left and cut down a piece of the tree
Right Arrow Key - Move to the right and cut down a piece of the tree
